<p>This is <b><span style="color: #af2c72">Tallinn</span></b>, the capital of <b><span style="color: #201ddd">Estonia</span></b>.<a href="#story/1752204/slide-1"></a></p>

 <p>The city is home to over <b><span style="color: #9a1ddd">40,000 people</span></b>
 — a third of the country's population. <a href="#story/1752204/slide-1"></a></p>

 <p>It's also been my hometown since <b><span style="color: #23952a">2015</span></b>. <a href="#story/1752204/slide-1"></a></p>

<p>Over the summer, these <b><span style="color: #1d43dd">blue</span></b> and <b><span style="color:#d37427">orange</span></b>
 signs start popping up around the city.<a href="#story/1752204/slide-2"></a></p>

<p>They show the location of public shelters, places to hide in an <b>emergency</b>.<a href="#story/1752204/slide-2"></a></p>

<p>Their installation was prompted by Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine.<a href="#story/1752204/slide-2"></a></p>

<p>Unlike Kyiv, <b>Estonia does not have a subway system</b>.<a href="#story/1752204/slide-2"></a></p>

<p> In March, the Rescue Board was tasked with mapping and signposting spaces. <a href="#story/1752204/slide-3"></a></p>

<p> The agency marked the first one in June, an underground carpark below Tallinn's central square, Vabaduse väljak. <a href="#story/1752204/slide-3"></a></p>

<p> Freedom Square in English. <a href="#story/1752204/slide-3"></a></p>

<p>Since then, <b><span style="color: #1d43dd">blue</span></b> and <b><span style="color:#d37427">orange</span></b> signs have been drilled onto walls across the capital's eight districts. But where are they?<a href="#story/1752204/slide-4"></a></p>

<p>But where are they?<a href="#story/1752204/slide-4"></a></p>

<p>There are nine shelters in <b><span style="color: #651192">Kesklinn </span></b>, the city centre, including one in a former Cold War-era bomb shelter which, until recently, was a bar. <a href="#story/1752204/slide-5"></a></p>

<p>There are five shelters in <b><span style="color: #651192">Haabersti</span></b>, <b><span style="color: #651192">Kriistine </span></b> and <b><span style="color: #651192">Mustamäe </span></b> districts.<a href="#story/1752204/slide-6"></a></p>

<p>There are two emergency shelters in <b><span style="color: #651192">Põhja-Tallinn </span></b>, both very close to the city's medieval Old Town.<a href="#story/1752204/slide-7"></a></p>

<p>There are two each in <b><span style="color: #651192">Pirita </span></b>, and <b><span style="color: #651192">Lasnamäe </span></b> — the city's biggest district with a population of 100,000. <a href="#story/1752204/slide-8"></a></p>

<p>And the final two are in <b><span style="color: #651192">Nõmme </span></b>, a suburb, a short drive or train ride from the city centre.<a href="#story/1752204/slide-9"></a></p>

<p>Since June,<b><span style="color: #d41c1c"> more than 70 </span></b> emergency shelters have been marked across the country with more to follow. <a href="#story/1752204/slide-10"></a></p>

<p>And a 16-city 4.5 million euro network of warning siren system is also under construction. It should be completed by July 2023.<a href="#story/1752204/slide-11"></a></p>

<p>This is the largest civil defence investment Estonia has made in 30 years.<a href="#story/1752204/slide-11"></a></p>
