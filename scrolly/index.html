<p>This is Tallinn, the capital of Estonia.<a href="#story/1752204/slide-1"></a></p>
 
 <p>The city is home to over 400,000 people — a third of the country's population. <a href="#story/1752204/slide-1"></a></p>

 <p>It's also been my hometown since 2015. <a href="#story/1752204/slide-1"></a></p>

<p>Over the summer, these blue and orange signs start popping up around the city.<a href="#story/1752204/slide-2"></a></p>
 
<p>They show the location of public shelters, places to hide in an emergency.<a href="#story/1752204/slide-2"></a></p>

<p>Their installation was prompted by Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine. Unlike Kyiv, Estonia has no subway system.<a href="#story/1752204/slide-2"></a></p>

<p> In March, the Rescue Board was tasked with mapping and signposting spaces. <a href="#story/1752204/slide-3"></a></p>
  
<p> The agency marked the first one in June, an underground carpark below Tallinn's central square, Vabaduse väljak. <a href="#story/1752204/slide-3"></a></p>
  
<p> Freedom Square in English. <a href="#story/1752204/slide-3"></a></p>
  
<p>Since then, blue and orange signs have been drilled onto walls across the capital's eight districts. But where are they?<a href="#story/1752204/slide-4"></a></p>
  
<p>But where are they?<a href="#story/1752204/slide-4"></a></p>
  
<p>There are nine shelters in Kesklinn, the city centre, including one in a former Cold War-era bomb shelter which, until recently, was a bar. <a href="#story/1752204/slide-5"></a></p>

<p>There are five shelters in Haabersti, Kriistine and Mustamäe districts.<a href="#story/1752204/slide-6"></a></p>

<p>There are two emergency shelters in Põhja-Tallinn, both very close to the city's medieval Old Town. (Balti jaam is in Kesklinn.)<a href="#story/1752204/slide-7"></a></p>

<p>There are two each in Pirita, and Lasnamäe — the city's biggest district with a population of 100,000. <a href="#story/1752204/slide-8"></a></p>

<p>And the final two are in Nõmme, a suburb, a short drive or train ride from the city centre.<a href="#story/1752204/slide-9"></a></p>

<p>Since June, more than 70 emergency shelters have been marked across the country with more to follow. <a href="#story/1752204/slide-10"></a></p>

<p>And a 16-city 4.5 million euro network of warning siren system is also under construction. It should be completed by July 2023.<a href="#story/1752204/slide-11"></a></p>

<p>This is the largest civil defence investment Estonia has made in 30 years.<a href="#story/1752204/slide-11"></a></p>
